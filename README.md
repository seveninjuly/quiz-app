# quiz-app
This is my first app, you can play it here:https://seveninjuly.github.io/quiz-app/.

The app has following features:
1. A starting screen, you can click the button "Go!" to get started.
2. There are ten questions in total, the questions appear one by one. Once you submit your answer, you'll see the answer feedback coming up. If you were incorrect, the feedback will let you know the correct answer.
3. On the top of the question section, there is a prompt bar showing how many questions you have answered and your current score. 
4. You won't be able to skip questions or go back to the previous ones, so keep trying and keep going!
5. Once you finish all the questions, there will be a final page showing your overall score, and also a restart button for you to try another time.

I use JQuery as the JavaScript library, and when structuring the HTML page, I used form  to render questions and answer choices. This website is also responsive and keyboard user friendly. Give it a shot and enjoy!
